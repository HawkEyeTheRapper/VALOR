## Context

“Relentless” is the fourth track on *Shadow Banned*, Hawk Eye The Rapper’s 2024 album. The title itself signals suppression — a crackdown on truth and unfiltered expression. In this track, Hawk Eye The Rapper steps into the fray not just as a rapper, but as a *musical mercenary* engaged in fourth-dimensional warfare. The song isn’t performance — it’s protocol. Following tracks like “Domestic Terrorist” and “Down The Rabbit Hole,” “Relentless” advances the resistance, pushing sonic and spiritual boundaries.

## Synopsis

At its core, *Relentless* is a 5-minute lyrical blitz — a manifesto disguised as a track. The hook sets the tone: an impatient, confrontational declaration aimed at both the hypnotized masses and the architects of deception.

- **Verse 1:** Establishes spiritual mandate + lyrical weaponry.  
- **Verse 2:** Targets language and law — narrative warfare begins.  
- **Verse 3:** Declares open rebellion, infiltrating power structures.

The track is psychological warfare set to rhythm — dense, deliberate, and disruptive.

## Verse-by-Verse Breakdown

### Verse 1 – Lyrical Warfare and Spiritual Intervention

The phrase “persistent and relentless run-on sentence” becomes both form and content. Hawk Eye The Rapper’s verse flows without pause — a ritualistic flood designed to clear the “atmospheric conditions.”

Key lines:
> “My lyrical intervention shifts the spiritual imprint of this system…”

> “I’m a poet so potent… overload the voltage so it blows a hole through their soul.”

### Hook – Confronting the Hypnotized

> “Basically I’m patiently awaiting the day you hypnotized dumb f**ks still stuck in the game come up with something more constructive…”

This is confrontation: blunt, profane, and uncompromising. The hook becomes a mantra — an alert to break the spell of collective hypnosis.

### Verse 2 – Rewriting the System’s Code

Here, Hawk Eye The Rapper rewrites law and language — the very scripts society obeys.

> “A musical mercenary heaven sent here to bury every unnecessary politician…”

> “Through persistent and consistent revisions of every sentence ever written by the Government…”

### Verse 3 – Final Indictment and Infiltration

This verse is pure fire. Hawk Eye The Rapper targets institutional strongholds and outlines the *Omniversal Infiltration*:

> “F**k the White House… Virtue signal competitions… Militia troops in position…”

The line about Building 7 opens the hidden archive — linking media, conspiracy, and spiritual truth in one salvo.

## Symbolism & Strategy

- **Reincarnation as Resistance**
- **Wordplay as Weaponry**
- **Spiritual Light vs. Hypnotic Dark**
- **Media Infiltration through Omniversal Media**

## Larger Mythos Connection

“Relentless” is part of Hawk Eye The Rapper’s larger canon:
- *The Martyr Mechanism*
- *The Scope of What’s to Come*
- *Behold A Pale Horse* and *Domestic Terrorist*

This track is the delivery mechanism of everything seeded in those works — the moment of detonation.

## Final Thoughts

Hawk Eye The Rapper’s “Relentless” is not just rap — it’s war protocol. The message?  
**You’re either part of the awakening, or in the way.**
